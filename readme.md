# SF - UTMS
This is a simple script that enabled use of UTM parameters on Salesfusion forms hosted on external websites. By default Salesfusion forms will not work with UTM parameters when hosted on an external website(Wordpress, Wix etc.)

# Usage
Simply copy the contents of the index.html file and place anywhere below the embedded Salesfusion Form. It can be placed in any location on the page as long as it loads after the Salesfusion Form.
